# FS17 T93 WaterTrailerFix - Special version

***WARNING***: You're looking at a development version of this mod. If you're not interested in developing, and simply want to play Farming Simulator with this mod, download it from [ModHub](http://farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=87372&title=fs2017) (Please not that this is **not** the special version of this mod). The code here might break your savegame, your computer, or your mind. 



## Special version
This is a special version of my mod, one that will **never** be on the GIANTS ModHub, due to their restrictions. You can however install this version manually, which I'll explain below. It will have the same functionality as the normal version.
If you want to contribute to this mod, please contribute to the ['master' branch](https://github.com/Timmiej93/FS17_T93_WaterTrailerFix), unless your contribution has something to do with the help menu adding.

### What is so special about it?
This version adds a section in the help menu for this mod, and my mods (T93 mods) in general. While this might not be very interesting for this mod, since it's relatively simple, it's more about creating a system that works.
What's special about how I add these help sections in the help menu, is that it allows for each one of my mods to add their own section of help menu to the already existing T93 Mods category. It also allows for each mod to overwrite the main section, which describes who I am and what I do, as long as the mod's *helpMenu.xml* file 

### How to install
Very simple! Simply click the *'Clone or download'* button, followed by the *'Download ZIP'* button. This downloads a file called *'FS17_T93_WaterTrailerFix-specialVersion.zip'*. Unpack this file to a temporary location. A folder with the same name as the file will appear. Select **all** data inside this folder (inside the folder, not the folder itself), and put this data in a new ZIP file. Simply put this new file in your mods folder, and that's it!



## Publishing / Media
